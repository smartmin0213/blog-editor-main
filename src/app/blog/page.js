              The Weekly Competitions: A Test of Skill and Strategy
            </h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Each week of the Odyssey will bring a new competition, each with its own unique challenges and rewards. Whether it's creating memes, engaging with our socials or sharing a current crypto news story, each competition will offer a new and exciting way to engage with the community. There will be three weekly competitions: Contentious, Hot News Weekly & AMA Hangouts. Submitting your entry alone will earn XP and enter you into a draw to win EHX tokens, whilst the winner will also win $100.

At the end of the month, the top five participants will share the grand prize, with a further five participants earning prizes through a raffle.

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
              <li>Registration: The first step is to sign up on Zealy's platform by connecting your crypto wallet or via email then head to our page and complete a quest (eg: Follow Twitter) <a href="https://zealy.io/c/synesxi/questboard" className="text-blue-400">https://zealy.io/c/synesxi/questboard</a></li>
              <li>Entering Competitions: Each week, new competitions will open automatically. To enter, simply click on the competition and follow the instructions to submit your entry.</li>
              <li>Earning XP: Simply submitting your competition entry earns you XP (Experience Points). However, winners will also earn bonus XP as will some raffle winners for each competition. There are also other ways to earn extra XP, including inviting friends and following socials.</li>
              <li>Climbing the Leaderboard: Your XP is automatically added to your profile on the leaderboard. Some quests require a manual review so you may have to wait an hour or two for your newly acquired XP to update.</li>
              <li>Winning Prizes: The prize distribution operates on two levels. Every week, winners are selected from individual competitions and awarded prizes accordingly. As we reach the culmination of the month, the grand spectacle unfolds with the participant at the summit of the leaderboard claiming the grand prize. The excitement, thus, is not only weekly, but builds up to a monthly crescendo.</li>
